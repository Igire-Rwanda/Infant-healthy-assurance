                help your baby to develop and grow and will help to 
        keep you fit and well. You don't need to go on a special diet, but make 
        sure that you eat a variety of different foods every day in order to get the 
        right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need.You will probably find that you are 
        more hungry than normal, but you don't need to eat for two even if 
        you are expecting twins or triplets. Have breakfast every day this will 
        help you to avoid snacking on foods that are high in fat and sugar. 
        You may have to change the amounts of different foods that you eat, rather 
        than cutting out all your favourites.</p>
